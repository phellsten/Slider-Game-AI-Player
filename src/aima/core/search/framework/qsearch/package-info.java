/**
 * This package contains different queue search implementations and a common
 * interface for them, which is implicitly defined by abstract class
 * {@link aima.core.search.framework.qsearch.QueueSearch}. Given a problem and a
 * non-empty queue of nodes (which is defined and initialized by some search
 * strategy), the implementations control search space exploration and return a
 * non-empty list of actions if a goal state was found.
